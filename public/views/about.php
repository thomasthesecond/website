  <h1 class="heading -huge">Product designer and  creative director</h1>

  <p class="copy">
    I’ve been with product companies as a product designer and/or Creative
    Director for 5 years. For the 5 years before that, I served as the
    Creative Director for a digital agency based in Nashville.
  </p>

  <p class="copy">
    Now I’m interested in spending time applying the knowledge gathered
    across those experiences and applying it to a small number of select
    clients, interested in using design to carve out a new path for
    themselves.
